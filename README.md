# Real-Time-Emotion-Recognition
This project is a real-time emotion recognition system that detects and classifies human emotions using facial expressions. It uses DeepFace for facial analysis and OpenCV for video feed processing. The system identifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more, in real-time video streams.
